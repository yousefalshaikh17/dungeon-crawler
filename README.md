# Dungeon Crawler

### Overview

Inspired by Persona 3 and Persona 4, I created a procedural generation system for dungeon design, aiming to give map designers full creative freedom. The system is fully modular, allowing for the generation of unique, customizable dungeons. Initially, I based the demo around recreating Tartarus from Persona 3, but as development progressed, I became more invested in enhancing the experience.

To build on this foundation, I introduced a companion system that uses pathfinding to allow companions to follow the player through the dungeon. Additionally, I integrated a dialogue system for dynamic banter and companion notifications, designed to resemble the interface seen in Persona 3 Reload.

### Development & Features

The project was developed on Roblox and their Luau language. Key development milestones included:

- **Procedural Generation System**: Developed a fully modular system that enables dynamic and random dungeon creation with customizable settings for map designers.
- **Companion System**: Integrated pathfinding for companions, allowing them to follow the player through the dungeon, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Dialogue System**: Added a dialogue system that enables banter and provides notifications from companions, with an interface styled after Persona 3 Reload.
- **Demo Content**: The demo is based on Tartarus from Persona 3, demonstrating the core procedural generation and companion mechanics.
- **Customizable Dungeon Design**: Map designers can create their ideal dungeons with the procedural generation system, providing a flexible and dynamic environment for exploration.

### Real-World Applications

While initially a demo, this project allowed me to dive deep into procedural generation, pathfinding, and dialogue systems. I gained insight into how games like Persona 3 might have handled these mechanics and applied that knowledge to enhance my system. This project serves as a solid foundation for future games that will include similar systems along with a more engaging combat system.

### Future Vision

Although this demo won't be published due to its reliance on intellectual property from Persona 3, I plan to build on this procedural generation system and companion mechanics in my own future game projects. This experience has provided me with invaluable insight into game development that will influence my approach to future designs and mechanics.

### Gameplay Demonstration

Due to a problem with video uploads, the demonstration video will be added at a later time.
